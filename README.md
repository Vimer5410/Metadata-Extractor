# About The Project
This project is a "taker" of metadata from images in C#, with the ability to display and modify them. In this example, I'm using Avalonia UI WITHOUT the MVVM pattern, because this application is so simple that it doesn't even need it. I was interested in trying to extract metadata and perform further operations on it.

## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in your IDE for C# development (for example, Visual Studio).
3. Run the application in windowed mode
4. Click on the folder and select from the list of images the ones you need and then upload them through the application interface
5. The image you selected will be shown on the left and its metadata on the right
6. Next, you can copy the metadata, edit it, or clear it all in the same application interface.
7.
